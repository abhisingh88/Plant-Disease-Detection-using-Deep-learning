Plant diseases are one of major reasons behind the production and economic losses in agriculture. 
Frequently the illnesses or its signs like colored spots or streaks can be observed on the plant leaves.
There is a wide spectrum of signs and symptoms which differ because of the cause or etiology of the plant disease.

Agricultural productivity is something on which economy highly depends. 
This is the one of the reasons that disease detection in plants plays an important role in agriculture field. 

Image based detection of plant diseases is an essential research topic as it may prove benefits in monitoring large fields of crops, and thus detect the symptoms of diseases as soon as they appear on plant leaves.
